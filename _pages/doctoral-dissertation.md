This dissertation focuses on human mobility prediction and its application in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). The research addresses two main challenges: developing accurate human mobility prediction models and applying these predictions to enhance MCS systems. Two frameworks are proposed to achieve these goals.

The first framework focuses on location prediction, introducing a two-phase approach that considers both the individual’s and their companions’ mobility patterns. It uses spatial closeness and person ID embedding vectors to identify companions and a stacked autoencoder to handle dimensionality. A bidirectional recurrent neural network model is then used to forecast future locations.

The second framework, named ‘Context-Aware Worker Recruitment based on a Mobility Prediction Model’ (CAMP), aims to efficiently select workers for MCS tasks. It predicts future worker locations and selects a group of workers to carry out tasks. CAMP improves upon traditional approaches by enhancing worker mobility prediction using a recurrent neural network-based model and introducing a weighted-utility algorithm for worker selection.

The performance of these frameworks was evaluated across diverse datasets, demonstrating higher predictive accuracy and more successful task completion within budget constraints compared to alternatives.
