Following the successful completion of my Ph.D. studies at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering (EECE) at the University of Ulsan, South Korea, I'm thrilled to embark on a new chapter as a postdoctoral researcher at AMNIS Labs. My academic journey began with a foundational Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology in Vietnam (2016). This experience instilled a strong interest in exploring the intricacies of hardware and software systems.

My current research endeavors delve into two captivating areas. The first focuses on task offloading, a technique that optimizes performance by strategically distributing computational tasks across multiple computing resources. This involves leveraging algorithms and communication protocols to ensure efficient workload management and minimize bottlenecks within distributed systems. In essence, we aim to achieve parallel processing by intelligently assigning tasks based on factors like processing power and resource availability.

The second area explores the burgeoning field of smart trading and robo-advisory systems. Here, the objective is to develop intelligent tools that can empower individuals to make informed investment decisions. These systems leverage machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to extract insights from vast datasets in the financial markets. However, it's crucial to emphasize that these tools are intended to be educational resources, not replacements for the expertise of qualified financial advisors.

Both research projects share a common thread: the desire to leverage advancements in computer science to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of complex systems. Whether it's optimizing distributed computing or demystifying the financial landscape, my research is driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to making a real-world impact.
