I'm Ngo Tan Quan, now diving into my postdoctoral research at the University of Ulsan, South Korea, within the Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Engineering Department. My academic journey began with obtaining my B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology in Vietnam in 2016. I recently completed my Ph.D., marking the end of an enriching chapter and the beginning of an exciting new phase in my career.

In my postdoc position at AMNIS Labs, I'm currently engaged in two main research areas. The first project focuses on task offloading, which in simpler terms means figuring out how to distribute tasks across different computer systems to make everything run more smoothly. It's all about finding the best ways to handle workloads to avoid bottlenecks and improve overall efficiency.

On a different note, my second project involves smart trading and robo-advisory systems. This work aims to make the stock market more accessible to everyone by developing tools that can analyze vast amounts of data and offer clear, actionable advice on buying and selling stocks. It's about helping people make informed decisions without needing to be finance experts.

Both projects are really about making complex systems more understandable and efficient, whether that's in computing or finance. I'm excited about the potential of these projects to make a real difference in their respective fields.
