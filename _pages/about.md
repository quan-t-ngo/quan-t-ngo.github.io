**From B.E. graduate to unordinary researcher, my journey continues!**

My journey in research continues with a postdoctoral position at AMNIS Labs, following the recent completion of my Ph.D. at the University of Ulsan, South Korea (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering). It's been a path paved with both challenges and incredible learning experiences, starting with my B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology in Vietnam (2016). There's always so much more to discover in the world of technology!

Currently, I'm delving into two research areas that I find particularly fascinating. The first involves task offloading, which essentially optimizes how tasks are distributed among computers for better performance. Think of it as constantly learning how to work smarter, not harder – a skill that benefits everyone in the tech world!

My second project explores the exciting world of smart trading and robo-advisory systems. Here, the goal is to make the stock market more accessible by developing tools that analyze vast amounts of data.  However, the financial world is complex, and these tools are meant to be educational resources – empowering individuals to make informed decisions with the help of data analysis, not replacing the valuable expertise of financial advisors.

At the core of both projects lies a desire to learn and contribute.  There's still so much to understand about complex systems, and I'm excited to be a part of the ongoing exploration in both edge computing and finance.
